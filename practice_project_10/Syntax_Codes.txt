1. Headings

Markdown:

# H1
## H2
### H3




2. Paragraphs
This is a paragraph.

This is another paragraph.




3. Line breaks (soft/hard)

Soft break (default): single newline usually becomes a space.

Hard break (two spaces at end-of-line or enable breaks option).

Example (hard break):

Line 1␣␣
Line 2



4. Emphasis / Strong / Combined
*italic*  _italic_
**bold**  __bold__
**_bold+italic_**


Becomes <em>, <strong>, and nested tags.

5. Strikethrough (GFM)
This is ~~deleted~~ text.


Produces <del>deleted</del> (GFM support).

6. Blockquotes
> A quote
>
> > Nested quote


Becomes <blockquote>...</blockquote> (nested allowed).

7. Lists

Unordered:

- Item A
- Item B
  - Subitem
* Another style


Ordered:

1. First
2. Second


Produces <ul> / <ol> and nested lists.

8. Task lists (GFM)
- [ ] todo item
- [x] done item


Renders as list items containing checkboxes (HTML <input type="checkbox" disabled> in many renderers). marked supports this GFM feature. 
marked.js.org

9. Code — inline and fenced blocks

Inline:

Use `const x = 1;` inline.


Block/fenced (with language hint):

```js
function sum(a,b){ return a+b; }

`marked` outputs `<code>` for inline, and `<pre><code class="language-js">...</code></pre>` for fences — good for client-side syntax highlighting libraries to hook into.

### 10. Horizontal rule
```md
---
***
___


Produces <hr>.

11. Links (inline, reference, automatic)

Inline:

[Google](https://www.google.com)


Reference:

[ref]: https://example.com
[link to ref][ref]


Autolink / email: <https://example.com> becomes a link.

You can customize link rendering via a custom renderer to add target/rel attributes. 
marked.js.org

12. Images
![alt text](https://example.com/image.png "title")


Renders <img src="..." alt="..." title="...">. marked will pass through image attributes; you can override rendering if needed.

13. Tables (GFM)
| Name | Age |
| ---- | ---:|
| Alice|  30 |
| Bob  |  25 |


Produces <table><thead>... etc. Table alignment support (left/center/right) is supported by GFM parsing.

14. Inline HTML passthrough

You can embed raw HTML:

<div class="note">Note text</div>


marked will output that HTML unless you sanitize/strip — use sanitize or external sanitizer if you need to restrict allowed HTML.

15. Escaping special chars

Use backslash:

\*not italic\*
